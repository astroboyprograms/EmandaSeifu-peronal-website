        <p>
            Emanda Seifu is a sophomore pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science with a minor in Political Science at Virginia Tech. With a keen interest in problem-solving, Emanda was naturally drawn toward computer science. Her fascination with this field began during her time in the STEM Impressionists Program (SIP), a non-profit organization that supports young girls from minority communities in exploring STEM.

            Emanda started her journey in SIP as a hostess for STEM activities and has since been an Executive Council Member for 7 years. She plans to utilize her knowledge and experience to continue supporting young girls in her community to explore STEM. Additionally, Emanda serves as an editor for the Collegiate Times, her college newspaper. Through this role, she has been able to combine her interests in journalism and computer science by contributing to the online publication.
